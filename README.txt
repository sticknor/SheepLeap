How to Play the Game:
'Space' to jump, 'up'/'down' keys to switch lanes.
'p' to pause/unpause game.
Jump over the fences to increase score.
The fences in the upper left corner indicate how many fences
to jump before moving to the next level. 
The number in the moon tracks how many total fences you have jumped.
If you successfully jump a fence, you get bonus time.
If you knock over a fence, you lose time.
Jump as many fences as possible before time runs out.

Cheat: Press 'h' to hover :-)

====================
Ideas used from week 1:
Used basic implementation of objects for game info, sheeps, fences, clouds. 
Utilized sprite sheets of original illustrations for animations.
Arrays used to represent lanes, for both fences and clouds.
Used git to work together as a team. 
Canvas elements, images, text, when resize canvas, everything resizes with it.
First class functions like CLOUD, moveFencesInLane, jumpSheep, drawScreen
